A Digital assistant that aids parents and students in understanding and  navigating inside the college campus 
# Problem Statement 
Traditional methods, like phone inquiries and website searches, cause delays and 
frustration for prospective college students during admissions due to slow responses and 
scattered information. Lack of efficient communication channels hinders easy access to 
essential campus details, leading to a need for a more streamlined and accessible 
information system. The problem lies in the inconvenience and inefficiency of the current 
methods, which can deter potential students from making informed decisions about their 
college choices. 
## Objectives of the Present Study 
The objectives of the proposed project are as follows: 
i. To build a digital assistant that aids parents and students in understanding and 
navigating inside the college campus 
ii. To use QR codes in campus to instantly access the information from the website
iii. To provide information about the college, including placement records, academic  
excellence, and a wide range of courses available with fees structure 
iv. To provide the chatbot with multilingual audio and comprehension abilities
