# Problem Statement 
Traditional methods, like phone inquiries and website searches, cause delays and 
frustration for prospective college students during admissions due to slow responses and 
scattered information. Lack of efficient communication channels hinders easy access to

information system. The problem lies in the inconvenience and inefficiency of the current 
methods, which can deter potential students from making informed decisions about their 
college choices.
